# Oak
Oak is a [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) compositor using the [wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/) library.
The primary target device is for smartphones and tablets. I'm still heavily learning about Wayland and wlroots, so a lot of the code
here is likely not ideal for reference.
